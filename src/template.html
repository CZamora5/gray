            Gray is an intermediate color between black and white. It is a neutral or achromatic color, meaning
            literally that it is "without color", because it can be composed of black and white

              Grey was the color of undyed wool, and thus was the color most commonly worn by peasants and the poor. It was also the color worn by Cistercian monks and friars of the Franciscan and Capuchin orders as a symbol of their vows of humility and poverty.

              Grey began to play an important role in fashion and art. Black became the most popular color of the nobility, particularly in Italy, France, and Spain, and grey and white were harmonious with it.

              Grey became a highly fashionable color both for women's dresses and for men's waistcoats and coats. It looked particularly luminous coloring the silk and satin fabrics worn by the nobility and wealthy.

              Women's fashion was dominated by Paris, while men's fashion was set by London. The grey business suit appeared in the mid-19th century in London - light grey in summer, dark grey in winter - replacing the more colorful palette of men's clothing early in the century.
